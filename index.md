TFT Display for Raspberry Pi 3
===============================

The Idea:
=========

Touch Screen. This project will let the user know His/Her position in line while he waits to get attention of a representative or an attendant.
Users can also lookup a product in store and once they are done shopping, they can fill out an E-Survey using a simple and interactive touch screen.
